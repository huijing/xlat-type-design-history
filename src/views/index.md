## I. A study through the lens of Shanghai

19世纪晚期，上海是西方列强软硬兼施所获得的100个通商口岸中最重要的一个，在西方印刷技术传入中国，本地化、市场化的过程中，处于主要地位。  
During the late 19th century, Shanghai was the most important and impressive of the 100 treaty ports scattered all over China, and one of the main gateways for Western printing technology to enter China.

在中国的大门被枪炮打开之前，来自不同教会的传教士们就试图进入中国，或开始为在中国传教而准备着。而来自官方的禁令，让传教士们不约而同地想到，通过印刷品的媒介，可以悄无声息地达成他们的使命。明代天主教传教士们可以公开在中国传教，而他们也没有采用明朝中期德国人古登堡发明的金属活字印刷技术，而是入乡随俗地直接使用了中国的雕版印刷术。公开传教的禁令，促使了清末的传教士们在中文金属活字的本地化上不屑地努力，经历了超过半个世纪的工作，他们终于成功地把这项技术带到了中国，为中国的现代化埋下了种子。  
Before China's doors were forced open by Western powers, various Christian missionaries were already attempting to enter China or preparing for proselytising missions. As their activities were still considered illegal by the Chinese authorities, many missionary organisations realised they could utilise print media to achieve their goal of spreading the message of the Gospel.  
Ming-era Catholic missionaries were freely operating in China, but they did not utilise Gutenburg's moveable type technologies for such purposes. Instead, they adopted woodblock printing technologies native to China. Restrictions on missionary activities resulted in missionaries' active experimentation and development of localised Chinese moveable type technologies.  
After half a century of such efforts, they finally brought Western print technology into China, planting the seed for Chinese modernity.

1842年，传教士麦都思把巴达维亚印刷所整体搬迁至上海，并成立墨海书馆。墨海书馆是上海最早的一个现代出版社，为上海最早采用西式汉文铅印活字印刷术的印刷机构。墨海书馆培养了一批通晓西学的学者，他们和传教士们撰写、翻译了许多介绍西方政治、科学、宗教的书籍，极大地促进了西学东传的进程。  
In 1842, Walter Henry Medhurst, who was a Protestant missionary, moved his print operations from Batavia (now Jakarta) to Shanghai, and established The London Missionary Society Press there. It was the earliest modern publishing house in Shanghai, and helped cultivate a crop of scholars who were versed in Western studies. Together with the missionaries, they wrote and translated numerous books on Western politics, science and religion, facilitating the spread of Western ideas into China.

与此同时，美国长老会的中文印刷出版机构，历经澳门华英校书房和宁波华花圣经书房两个时期后，终于在1860年迁至上海，展开了近代中国印刷出版史上具有非常重要角色与功能的美华书馆时期。  
At the same time, the American Presbyterian Mission Press (APMP), which was founded in Macao and later moved to Ningbo, before finally establishing a larger quarters in Shanghai in 1860. This marked the start of Chinese publishing history's most important and productive era.

期间，由姜别利担当主任负责馆务的最初九年（1860-1869），是美华书馆最重要的一段时期，他在这九年中延续并完成了从宁波时期开始的各项重要技术建设，引进了电镀活字和电镀铜板技术来华，大量降低了印刷成本。除了改进技术，姜别利也培育了从刻字、印刷、装订到铸字各部门的中国工匠，因而奠定美华书馆坚实的基础。美华书馆在中文印刷从木刻改变成西式技术的过程中，扮演中国规模最大的西式印刷机构兼中文活字主要供应者的关键角色。姜别利把在美化书馆发展成熟的电镀活字技术，传播到了日本，从而开启了日本金属活字铸造的历史。  
During this period, the APMP was led by William Gamble for its first nine years of operations (1860–1869). This was the most crucial period for the APMP, as Gamble managed to continue and finish the work which first started in Ningbo on the experimental technology of electrotyping for the creation of typefaces, greatly reducing the costs of production.  
In addition to improving print technologies, Gamble also nurtured Chinese craftsmen's skills, from type-cutting to printing, bookbinding to casting types, building up a strong foundation for the APMP. As the APMP made the move from woodblock printing to Western mechanisation and use of metal types, they became the largest provider of Western print technologies and Chinese moveable types in China. Gamble also fully developed electrotyping at the APMP, and introduced this technology to Japan, kickstarting the era of metal moveable types in Japan.

墨海书馆和美华书馆的辉煌过后，很快被中国出版商吞并，上海的民族资本进入印刷业，自己开发活字。其中，上海商务印书馆是推动20世纪中国西式印刷技术发展最重要的公司。1923年，商务印书馆兼并了美华书馆，这象征着古腾堡的印刷技术和传教士的印刷事业已完全中国化，越来越多的中国印刷商和出版商将凸版印刷术与石印术当作自有（theirs）技术。19世纪西方人创造的四种主要中文活字（戴尔字、科尔字、姜别利字和美查字）被中国印刷商——尤其是商务印书馆和中华书局——弃用，他们开始在工业化的中文印刷中自主设计与生产更符合中国人审美的中文金属活字。  
The golden age of the London Mission Press and the American Presbyterian Mission Press was shortlived as they soon were absorbed by Chinese publishing houses. Locals in Shanghai started investing in the printing industry and started developing moveable types themselves. Amongst these publishing houses, Shanghai's Commercial Press was the most influential in pushing forward the development Western printing technologies.  
In 1923, the APMP was merged into the Commercial Press, symbolising the complete sinicisation of Gutenburg and his missionary descendants. By this time, increasing numbers of Chinese printers and publication houses began to see both relief and planographic technology as their own.  
The four major fonts created by 19th century Westerners (Dyer's, Cole's, Gamble's, and Major's) fell out of favour with Chinese printers, especially those at the Commercial Press and Zhonghua Books. They had began to make their own judgements on what the Chinese typographic aesthetic ought to be during this age of industralisation.

上海是近代中国的印刷、报业、出版业的中心，而与这些行业紧密相连的活字铸造行业，也曾经冠绝全国。上海铸字制版同业工会曾经拥有众多会员，各家厂家纷纷开发自己的字体，不同的字体充分竞争，争奇斗艳，加上与日本的字体交流，为教育、文化、商业等领域提供了那个年代的视觉承载。  
Shanghai is the centre of modern Chinese printing, journalism and publishing. These industries are tightly coupled with the industry of casting moveable types, and were once unrivaled across the country. The Shanghai typecasting trade union used to have numerous members, and each foundry was developing their own typefaces, competing against one another on design and aesthetics. In addition, there was exchange of ideas from Japanese typefaces as well. Forming the basis of the visual aesthetic for education, culture and industry among many other aspects of society.

## II. The first group of professional Chinese type designers

解放后中国金属活字的设计及制作，按行业内的说法，主要集中在「一所三厂」——即赫赫有名的上海印刷技术研究所、<span class="checkagainst">上海字模一厂、二厂和北京新华字模厂</span>。当时，位于印刷出版中心上海的——上海印刷技术研究所（以下简称「印研所」）成为了主要设计单位，对后来的字体设计发展影响巨大。上海印刷技术研究所正式成立于 1956 年，其中的活字字体研究室成立于1960年，那里是真正开展字体设计工作的地方。字体设计师，这一前无古人的划时代职业，就此开始在中国创立。  
After liberation, China's moveable metal type design and production was focused at a single location, consisting of three factories. The famous Shanghai Printing Technology Research Institute, the Shanghai First Font Factory and Second Font Factory, and the Beijing Xinhua Font Factory. At the time, as the main centre for printing, the Shanghai Printing Technology Research Institute became the main unit for design work, and was hugely influential on the development of type design in the years to come.  
The Shanghai Printing Technology Research Institute was established in 1956, and within the organisation, the research lab for moveable types was formed in 1960. That was where the development of type design truly took place. Type designers, a profession which had never existed in China before, came to being right here.

谈到当时要创立活字字体研究室的原因，研究所的老设计师们都会追溯到1959年的德国莱比锡国际书籍艺术博览会。彼时，上海出版局集中好几位资深的美术编辑，制作了一批精品书籍以及大型画册，夺得了多项金奖，但唯有印刷字体评价最差。汉字字数数以万计，笔划有多有少，少的是一两笔，多的要几十笔。过去的字都是手工刻出来的，笔划少的字就很淡，笔划多的字就很黑。因此有人讲一个版面像「苍蝇」一样，深深淡淡，非常不好看，同西文和日文字体的质量根本没办法相比。出版界的老前辈，中国文化部副部长胡愈之先生看到了，心里过意不去：新中国已经成立十年了，字体还是这般差劲。于是他当即决定成立印刷字体研究所，并决定放在上海，<span class="checkagainst">上海出版局</span>局长汤季宏立即响应，两人一拍即合。  
When discussing the establishment of the Shanghai Printing Technology Research Institute, the old type designers from the research institute trace the reason back to the 1959 Leipzig Book Fair in Germany. At the time, Shanghai publishing had gathered a number of very experienced art directors who worked together to create a batch of exquisite books and large scale art books, which won many awards. However, the assessment of printed type faces left much to be desired.  
Han characters number in the tens of thousands, each character made up of practically any number of strokes. Some have only one or two, others have more than ten. In the past, each character was carved by hand, and characters with few strokes appeared rather faint, while those with many strokes were very dark.  
Hence, there was feedback that the page layout resembled a swarm of flies, and did not look pleasing to the eye. The quality of the typeface was sub-par when compared with the Latin typefaces or Japanese typefaces. Hu Yuzhi, an old hand of the print world and deputy minister of the Ministry of Culture was rather upset to hear such feedback. The People's Republic of China had been established for a decade, and yet the quality of typefaces was still so bad. He then decided to establish the Printing Technology Research Institute in Shanghai. The Director-General of the Shanghai Publishing Bureau, Tang Jihong, immediately responded in the affirmative and the decision was confirmed.

不过，除了在国外展会丢面子这个理由，推动汉字字体设计还有两个更重要的原因。上海作为中国近代以来印刷和铸字行业的中心，建国后的公私合营对行业做了整合，在技术标准逐渐统一的情况下，字体也亟待统一。自五四新文化运动以来，汉字文字简化、拉丁化的浪潮就前赴后继地波开。建国后，我国经过了矫枉过正的简化字反复后，才最终达到了我们今天使用的简化字的「简度」。为了普及和规范简化新字，需要尽快做出规范的简体印刷文字，而这一切的起点，就是新字体的设计。  
However, aside from losing face at an international fair, there were 2 even more important reasons for pushing forth the development of Han character and type design. Shanghai had become modern China's centre for printing and type casting. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the integration of public and private enterprise and the unification of technological standards resulted in a rapid consolidation of typefaces.  
Since the May Fourth Movement, Han characters underwent a simplification process, and the trend of Latinisation was kickstarted. The Chinese writing system underwent two rounds of character simplifications but the second round was well received and was retracted. Eventually, we settled onto a stable set of the List of Commonly Used Standardized Characters which are in use today. In order to encourage the widespread use and standardisation of simplified characters, it was necessary to produce typefaces with these simplified characters. The origin of all this was the design of new typefaces.

### 团队建立 - Forming the team

如何着手呢？中国的文字、印刷字体不可能脱离现实，总要有个基础。于是当时的文化部长胡愈之制定了「整旧创新，目前以整旧为主」的方针，从各个地方调集了三方面的设计人员：来自出版系统的书籍封面设计师、印刷厂的刻字技工，以及有汉字书法基础的人员。美术、刻字、书法三方面结合，组成了最初的字体研究室团队。  
How would one begin such an endeavour? Chinese characters and print typefaces cannot escape reality, there must be a foundation on which to build upon. As such the Minister of Culture at the time decided to focus on improving and enhancing the old as a means of creating something new. He gathered designers from three different domains, those who designed book covers at publishing houses, type engravers from the printing factories and those with strong fundamentals in calligraphy. The first team assembled at the research institute was an amalgamation of talent from the world of art, calligraphy and type engraving.

来自各个系统的精英汇聚一堂，还有钱君匋名家等做顾问。面对陌生的工作内容，所有人都没有任何经验。说是字体研究，主要工作就是依靠手工完成工作量巨大的字体设计和绘制，在实践中研究，在研究中实践。  
The cream of the crop from each respective domain, as well as the famous expert, Qian Juntao, who joined the team as a consultant, all came under one roof. Nobody had any experience in this never-seen-before scope of work. Even though it was supposed to be research into typefaces, the main bulk of work was the manual design and sketching of huge numbers of glyphs. Both the research and implementation were concurrent processes.

### 设计任务 - The task of design

团队组建完成后，首要任务就是规范简体字笔形，因为60 年代之前，很多字的写法都不规范。比如「点」，就可以有 7 种笔形。横划可以代表点，比如言字旁上的点。还有一挑，也可以代表一点，比如「冬」字，最下面一点以前是写成一挑的。还有一撇，也可以代表点。还有捺、竖等，各种笔形都可以代表点。印研所想到的办法是，以楷体为基础，即草体楷化。比如说言字旁的竖勾，60 年代公布时，刻字师傅为了要方正，就把笔画分开。  
After the team was formed, their first task was to standardise the stroke styles of the new simplified characters. Before the 60s, the writing of many characters were not standardised. For example the character, “点” had 7 different stroke styles. A horizontal stroke could indicate a dot, like the dot on the “言” radical. There is also the “flick” stoke, which could indicate a dot as well, like the in character “冬”, the second dot could be written as a “flick”.  
Then we have the piě diagonal stroke, which could also represent a dot. The nà diagonal stroke, and the vertical stroke could all represent dots. The solution which the research institute came up with is to use KaiTi as a foundation, and adapt the CaoShu script into a Kai style. For example, when the simplified “言” radical was introduced in the 60s, type engravers chose to separate the vertical and hook stroke for the sake of structure.

在印研所的努力下，1961年9月正式发布了<span class="checkagainst">《汉字印刷字体技术规范》</span>，并开始了为《辞海》定制设计新的简化字字体——用于正文的宋一和用于书眉、标题的黑一。1960至62年，字体设计师们为1965年版的《辞海》设计出了全部的正文宋一字体。1978年至1983年，又为《汉语大字典》正文排版用字，对宋一进行了扩充，前后共完成字符数63,561字。  
The efforts of the research institute paid off and their released the “Han characters printing typeface technical specifications” in August 1961. This was the start of the design of new simplified character typefaces for “CiHai”, using the Song 1 font as the body copy and the Hei 1 font for headers and titles. From 1960 to 1962, type designers designed a full set of Song 1 characters for the body copy of the fifth edition of “CiHai”. From 1978 to 1983, they once again expanded the character set of Song 1 for the body copy of the “Hanyu Da Zidian”. At the end of it, Song 1 contained 63,561 glyphs in its character set.

2009年6月22日，上海市人民政府公布了《第二批上海市非物质文化遗产名录》，其中第八类的传统手工技艺的 VIII-35为<span class="checkagainst">「汉字印刷字体书写技艺」</span>，申报单位为上海印刷技术研究所。字体设计和字体设计师，这一前无古人的工作和职业，仅仅经历了两代人，就成了堪比熊猫的文化遗产。经过整理归纳，今天的人们列出了当年字体设计的七道工序：  
On 22 June, 2009, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government released the Second Provincial List of Intangible Cultural Heritage for the Shanghai Municipality, and the Han character printing, typeface and calligraphy skill was included in the eighth category of Traditional Handicraft Skills. This brand new profession and job role became as valuable a cultural treasure as the Panda in merely two generations. After some organisation and summarisation, we currently have seven processes used for designing typefaces back in the day:

1.	铅笔稿，指设计者用铅笔在专用纸上按自己的设计意图勾勒出字体轮廓，确定风格。  
Pencil sketches, where the designers sketch out their the outlines of the characters with pencil on specialised paper according to their desired design, to ensure the right style.
2.	画线，指设计者对字稿的横、竖笔画用直线画出黑色线条，要求线条光洁，色调一致。  
Line drawings, where designers draw straight black lines for the horizontal and vertical strokes of the characters from the sketches, such lines must be bright, neat and uniform in colour.
3.	勾线，指将字形中的点、撇、捺、勾、挑等笔画用毛笔勾出清晰轮廓，要求线条挺拔光洁，笔形准确。  
Curved lines, refers to creating a clear structure of various calligraphic strokes using a brush, ensuring the end result consists of tall and clean lines with accurate strokes.
4.	填墨，指将勾画好的轮廓擦去铅笔线条，然后用黑色填满空当，要求色调一致。  
Inking, refers to removing the pencil lines from the completed character structures and filling the lines with black ink, ensuring a uniform and even colour.
5.	描白，指按照规范对成型后的字稿进行精细加工，去除毛刺，使笔画圆润。  
Tracing, refers to the refinement of completed character structures by removing any blot lines and ensuring the strokes are well-rounded.
6.	评字，指将设计好的字稿分批成行、成列地贴在对开幅面的硬纸上，通过照相缩成小样，逐字逐行进行集体评议。  
Character assessment, where the finished characters are split into batches and mounted side-by-side on hard paper, then photographed to shrink the entire setup for easier examination of each row and column of characters.
7.	审稿，课题负责人按《印刷通用汉字字形表》和相应规范，进行一次全面的审查，最后定稿。  
Review, where the person-in-charge checks the characters against the “List of Standard Forms of Characters for Printing” as an overall review and finalisation of the typeface.

但做字也并非一蹴而就的事，需要反复修改。在七个步骤之中，有一个过程非常关键——评字。每位设计师把写好的字贴出来给大家评判。原本出身美工、刻字和书法的设计师，对于汉字字体设计的理解各有不同：美工写的字相对来说比较整齐；刻字工虽懂得印刷字体的要求，但是刻出来不够漂亮；写书法的人字写得漂亮，讲求每个字的个性。来自不同背景的设计师们逐渐取得了共识，认识到印刷字体同书法是不同的。不像书法讲究个性，印刷字体讲究共性——一个字和其他任何字排在一起，要非常协调一致。三方面取长补短，字体设计工作才得以顺利进行。  
Creating a typeface is not a one-off task. It requires constant revisiting and revision. Of these seven steps, the most important is character assessment. Every designer presents the character they have completed for review by other team members. As each team member are domain experts in different fields, their understanding of type design naturally varies.  
The artists' characters were generally neater, while the engravers, although fully understanding the requirements, would tend to be unable to create characters that were beautiful enough. The calligraphers' characters would be very beautiful, and highlighted the unique personality of each individual character. As all these designers from different backgrounds gradually gained a mutual understanding, they also began to realise the distinction between calligraphy and print typefaces.  
Where calligraphy calls for uniqueness and individual flavour, print typefaces value harmony between all the characters. Experts from all three domains managed to complement each other well, allowing the work to proceed smoothly.

### 其他字体 - Other typefaces

在艰难摸索中完成了宋一、黑一体后，字体设计师们的经验变得更为丰富，手法也更为老练，先后完成了更多的印刷字体。  
After the herculean task of creating the Song 1 and Hei 1 typefaces, the type designers had gained a incredible amount of experience and honed their skills even more. Subsequently, they managed to create even more print typefaces.

宋二黑二：为《毛选》等代表的普通书籍所作的字体，与宋一黑一相比字号更多；参考中国雕版古籍字体，中宫更紧，字面更小，更符合中国人的审美。  
Song 2 and Hei 2, created for the “Selected Works of Mao Zedong” and such ordinary publications. Consists of more glyphs than Song 1 and Hei 1. References the character styles of engravings from ancient China, where the ZhongGong (中宫, which depicts the density of a Chinese character) is tighter and the character face is much smaller, which fits the aesthetic preference of the Chinese people.

标题宋：1964 年完成，周今才主持设计，设计字数 6196 字。  
Heading Song, designed by Zhou Jincai and completed in 1964, with a total of 6196 glyphs.

宋三：1964 年完成，施渭峰主持设计，设计字数：6196 字，更偏中国古典字体，字身修长。  
Song 3, designed by Shi Yufeng and completed in 1964, with a total of 6196 glyphs. This typeface had even more of an ancient character style with a much taller character style.

宋黑：1965 年完成，徐学成主持设计，设计字数 5000 字。  
Song Hei, designed by Xu Xuecheng and completed in 1965, with a total of 5000 glyphs.

行头宋：1970—72年所作，周今才主持设计，设计字数 6196 字。  
Line-heading Song, designed by Zhou Jincai and produced between 1970–72, with a total of 6196 glyphs.

### 文革危机 - The Crisis of the Cultural Revolution

正当字体设计师们信心满满，对汉字字体设计开始有更深入的认识和把握时，政治风暴的来临险些使他们的事业翻船。  
Just as the type designers were brimming with confidence, and developing a much deeper understanding of Han characters and how to design them, the upcoming political instability threw a wrench into their operations.

字体的评审不再局限在设计室内部，判官也换成了没有太多文化的工农兵们。被政治运动神话了的太仓农妇顾阿桃，因为毛泽东思想学得好，成为了最有发言权的字体评审。然而可惜的是，她并不识字。
好日子没那么长。很快，字体设计室被解散。研究所被认为是上层建筑，要和工厂结合，要和工农兵结合，唯一去向就是到字模厂。所以当时研究所的成员全部被「下放」到上海字模一厂去了。  
Character assessments were no longer restricted to members of the research institute, and the reviewers were now largely uncultured farming folk. Gu Atao, a countrywoman from Taicang who achieved legendary status during the Cultural Revolution for her ability to recite Quotations from Chairman Mao, became the most vocal and influential reviewer. Unfortunately, she was illiterate.  
Good times did not last, and before long the type design department was dismantled. The research institute was seen as a high quality building, to be combined for use in industrial manufacturing and agricultural activities. The only path for the type designers was to work at the font factories. Hence, all the members of the research institute were “demoted” to the Shanghai First Font Factory.

参看西文字体的历史，不少著名字体设计师，本也是字体雕刻工匠。上海印研所字体设计室里的设计师们，不少原先也是刻字工人。让他们去字模厂，似乎不是一个最坏的事情。在没有电脑的年代，字体设计师们用手工书写出一个个挺括的字稿，交到字模厂，用机器雕刻出金属字或铜字模，再翻铸成铅合金活字，提供给下游的印刷厂排版和印刷。技与艺，技往往决定了艺的高度。  
If we examine the history of Western typography, we find that numerous well-known type designers also used to be engravers. For the type designers of the Shanghai Printing Technology Research Institute, being sent to work at a font factory does not seem like that bad a thing. In a pre-digital era, type designers would draw each character by hand, and pass these on to the font factory, where metal or bronze types were engraved by machinery, before being cast into individual metal sorts. These were sent downstream to the various print factories to be laid out and used for printing. When it comes to skill versus art, skill is often what determines the level of artistic output.

字体设计师的下放使得字模一厂被迫成立了新的部门——画稿组，直接设在了雕刻机车间的边上。文革后期，一些刚毕业的初中生通过选拔，进入了画稿组，为字体设计注入了新鲜血液。70年代末，印刷研究所恢复，一些字体设计师回到研究所，也有一些留在了字模一厂，直到退休。  
Accepting the crop of type designers meant the First Font Factory was forced to create a new department for them. They were sat next to the engraving machines. After the Cultural Revolution, a number of middle school graduates who passed the selection tests also joined that department, bringing in some new blood to the type design world at the time.  
By the end of the 70s, some of the type designers returned to the research institute after printing research was re-established, while others remained at the First Font Factory until retirement.

### 文革之后：创写新字体，但没有积极开发 - Post Cultural Revolution: New typefaces were created but not actively developed

1950年代，手动照相排版机开始进入中国。70年代末期，照相排版技术已经在中国被成熟吸收。铅印会导致油墨铺张，得到的印刷文字会比原有字模略粗，而照相感光则会把文字的边缘吃掉而变细。设计师们的回归及时地解决了这个问题。1979年，上海印刷技术研究所引进了Monotype的照排机，把宋体、标题宋、黑体、仿宋和楷体重新修改，成为适合招排的字体。徐学成主持了整体工作，并负责了标题宋和仿宋的工作；周今才负责了宋体；张家声负责楷体；谢培元负责了黑体。  
During the 1950s, phototypesetting was introduced to China. By the end of the 70s, phototypesetting had already been well-established within China. Letterpress printing has the issue of ink spread, resulting in the printed characters being much thicker than originally designed, while characters printed with phototypesetting had much thinner strokes.
The type designers had returned just in time to solve this problem. In 1979, the Shanghai Printing Technology Research Institute brought in the Monotype-produced phototypesetting machine, and re-designed Song, Header Song, Hei, FangSong and Kai typefaces into signature typefaces. Xu Xuecheng had orchestrated this entire project and was in charge of Heading Song and FangSong. Zhou Jincai was in charge of SongTi. Zhang Jiasheng was in charge of KaiTi. And Xie Peiyuan was in charge of HeiTi.

1981年，有关部门组织了字体设计师们去西安碑林和龙门石刻采风，吸取营养。从1982年开始征稿，到1984年在北京举办的<span class="checkagainst">全国印刷新字体展评会</span>上，涌现出了一大批新面貌的字体。  
In 1981, the relevant organisation arranged for the type designers to visit the Stele Forest in Xi'an and Longmen stone carvings for inspiration. Work began in 1982 on designing new typefaces, and by the time the 1984 National Printing Typeface Expo rolled around, a large number of brand new typefaces had been produced.

1987年，日本森泽字体公司对中国大陆开放了自己的字体设计竞赛，上海印刷研究所字体设计室的设计师们积极参与，陆华平获得了一等奖，徐学成得了优秀奖。这两款字体都交由上海印刷研究所开发成了完整的字库，日本人以每个字11美金的设计费用购买，在当时引起了轰动。1988年，又有四位设计师获得了日本写研字体设计竞赛的佳作奖：金伟民、谢培元、原伟民、邹秀英。其中三位来自上海印刷研究所字体设计室。  
In 1987, Japanese font foundry, Morisawa, opened their type design competition to Chinese entries. The designers from the Shanghai Printing Technology Research Institute were active participants and several of them won awards. Lu Huaping won the Gold prize, and Xu Xuecheng won an Honorable Mention. Both their designs were expanded into complete typefaces at the Shanghai Printing Technology Research Institute.  
Japanese bought the typeface at a price of USD11 per character, causing quite a sensation at the time. In 1988, another four designers won awards at the Shaken type design competition in Japan, namely Jin Weimin, Xie Peiyuan, Yuan Weimin and Zou Xiuying. Of the four, three were from the Shanghai Printing Technology Research Institute.

虽然屡屡在日本获奖，褒扬和荣誉的光环却暗藏迷药。中国的<span class="checkagainst">字体开发单位</span>，并没有积极自主地开发新字体，却把设计师们费劲心力的优秀作品，送去了日本，以获奖创收为荣。而创作字体的设计师，却只得到了有限的报酬。到了90年代，随着老一辈字体设计师的陆续退休和过世，齐立等年轻一代设计师的离开，青黄不接、后继无人的危机逼促地扑面而来。  
In spite of the acclaim of winning numerous awards overseas in Japan, there was a disheartening truth which cast a shadow over this praise and prestige. China's own type development unit were not actively developing new typefaces yet constantly sent over quality works by their own designers to Japan for the purpose of winning awards. These award-winning designers, however, only received very limited compensation for their work. During the 90s, as the pioneering generation of type designers retired and passed away, while younger designers like Qi Li, left the research institute, there was a huge succession problem.

### 印研所无偿提供字稿，成为字体公司起步基础 - The Research Institute's constant output of new typefaces formed the basis of today's type foundries

从1974年开始，我国启动了一项名为748工程的综合性系统工程，748工程包含三个部分：精密照排、中文检索和中文计算机通信三个部分。被誉为现代毕升的北大教授王选是「精密中文编辑排版系统」的总负责人。科研攻关，数字化中文输入和编辑，以及排版技术取得了很大的进步。作为国家级工程，上海印刷研究所无偿为748工程提供了五款基础字体的字稿——为了Monotype照排设备修改的宋体、标题宋、黑体、仿宋和楷体，也成为了日后方正等字体公司起步的基础电脑字体。  
From 1974, China started the “748 Project” which was a system unification project. This project consisted of three parts, precision phototypesetting, Chinese character search and retrieval, and Chinese digital communications. Remembered as the “Modern Bi Sheng”, Beijing University professor, Wang Xuan, was put in charge of the research and development of a precision phototypesetting system for Chinese characters. This research project greatly improved the digitisation of Chinese input and editing, as well as typesetting capabilities.  
As a national-level project, the Shanghai Printing Research Institute contributed the designs for five basic typefaces to the 748 Project, namely the SongTi, Heading Song, HeiTi, FangSong and KaiTi typefaces which were redesigned for phototypesetting. This also formed the basis for Founder Type and other type foundries' fundamental digital typefaces.
